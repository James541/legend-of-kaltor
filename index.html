        Welcome to The Legend of Kaltor.
        <br />
        <br />
        You are battered but not broken. After being abducted from your bed and
        mildly beaten, you had a sack tied over your head and were thrown in the
        back of wagon.
        <br />
        <br />
        Many hours passed on the road, when suddenly, and violently, the wagon
        was smashed open and thrown down a steep embankment.
        <br />
        <br />
        This is where your adventure begins.
